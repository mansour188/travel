        <p> <em> For those who aren’t quite up to scratch on their geography, Tunisia is a small country in North Africa squeezed in between Algeria and Libya. It’s an incredibly vibrant country, with a diverse range of French, Italian, Arabic and African cultural heritage, and a landscape which stretches along the coast of the Mediterranean down to the Sahara desert. I was lucky enough to spend a year living there as a student in 2007 and completely fell in love with the country and its people. </em> </p>

        <p> A good and tasty variety of flavours, combining Mediterranean (mostly French but also Italian) and North African culinary traditions. This fusion and diversity come from the many civilisations which have ruled the land: Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Spanish, Turkish, Italians, French, and the native Punics-Berber people

    <p class="event">
    As the name may have given away, this festival is held in the popular area of Hammamet in the peak of the summer, on 12 July to be precise. It is one of the most significant festivals in the country and while live music is one of its premier attractions, it’s also possible to see art exhibitions, poetry readings or even talks from famous Arab writers.

    <li class="Event">International Jazz Festival
    </li>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Tabarka%2C_d%C3%A9cembre_2014_%2825%29.jpg/1024px-Tabarka%2C_d%C3%A9cembre_2014_%2825%29.jpg" alt="photo of Sculpture dedicated to the Tabarka jazz festival" width="200">
  
   <p class="event"> Slightly earlier on in the year is the International Jazz Festival, with this being held between June 29 and 7 July. This time the lucky destination is Tabarka and it would be fair to say that the nature of this festival is much different to the previous one discussed. This time the main theme is jazz music and it was only last year that this festival returned, following a four year absence. Prior to that, it had been running since 1973 and has featured some of the most popular musicians such as Billy Paul, Nougaro and Ahmad Jamal. This is one festival which can attract Jazz enthusiasts from all over Tunisia and the news that it was to return last year was met with great satisfaction.</p>
   <li class="Event">International Festival of Carthage
   </li>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Logo_du_festival_international_de_Carthage.png/800px-Logo_du_festival_international_de_Carthage.png" alt="photo of Carthage International Festival logo" width="200">
   <p class="event"> As the name highlights, this is a festival held in Carthage and happens to attract people from around the world. This year, it will be held between 12 July and 23 August, and will be the 50th time it has occurred. Music is the main theme, although there are also places for theatre, ballet, opera and cinema. The setting for this prestigious festival is the local amphitheatre and the fact that it has attracted the likes of Shaggy and One Republic in the past highlights its soaring reputation.

   <li class="Event">Ulysses Festival
   </li>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Musiciens_djerbiens.jpg" alt="photo of Group of Djerbian musicians." width="200">
    <p class="event">Ulysses Festival is slightly shorter than some of the more recent festivals that we’ve taken a look at, with this taking place between 17 July and 25 July. It’s held in Jerba and is unsurprisingly made to celebrate the life of Ulysses who had visited Tunisia. It’s primarily a dance festival and if you arrive in time, you’ll see the first display which is deigned to decipher Ulysses himself. This is a festival which is not just limited to Tunisians though, and you’ll also find acts originating from the likes of Greece, India and Italy amongst other nations.

 
    </p>
    <li class="Event">International Festival of Testour (Malouf)    </li>
    
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Place_Testour.jpg/800px-Place_Testour.jpg" alt=" photo of Square in front of the mosque"width="200">

    <p class="event">Anyone who is familiar with Tunisian culture will recognise this festival in an instant. It has been created to savour Arab music known as Malouf, which has become hugely popular since it reached the country at the back-end of the 15th Century. This year it will take place in Testour between 17 July and 31 July, and as well as the standard Malouf performances there will be workshops and exhibitions which aim to educate visitors on the origins and style of this form of music.

    <li class="Event">Plastic Arts Festival
    </li>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Weltsolidarit%C3%A4t.jpg"alt ="photo of statue Solidarité mondiale"width="127">
    <p class="event">Lasting for just over two weeks between 22 July and 6 August, the Plastic Arts Festival in Mahres is a little more low-key than some of the other events that have been discussed. This is held on one of the smallest fishing towns of the area and rather than concentrate on music and dance, it is instead a festival to showcase some of the finest Tunisian artists around. Even if nothing in any of the art galleries takes your fancy, there is always the nearby beach which houses countless statues.
    </p>
    <li class="Event">Sahara Festival in Douz
    </li>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Douz_downtown_01.JPG/1024px-Douz_downtown_01.JPG"alt="Place des martyrs in Douz."width="200">
    <p class="event">If you happen to be heading out to Tunisia for the winter, the Sahara Festival in Douz between 8 November and 11 November is one not to be missed. In fact, it’s probably THE festival of the year and having taken place since 1910 it would fair to say that it’s one of the most prominent events that is held in the country. The bulk of the festival takes place in the H’naiech stadium and boasts some of the most cultural features you’d find in such an event. For example, camel marathons are not uncommon, while it’s also possible to witness the practice of sloughi desert hunting dogs.
    </p>
    <li class="Event">International Festival for Symphonic Music
    </li>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Ouverture_festival_d%27el_jem_2013.jpg" alt="photo of Festival for Symphonic Music in El jem" width="200">
    <p class="event">This is perhaps one of the more interesting festivals to don the country, with the International Festival for Symphonic Music being held in El Jem between 14 July and 11 August. There are a total of seven shows of symphonic and orchestral music, with the likes of Egypt, Poland, Australia and of course Tunisia being some of the nations behind such work. The festival has now been going for almost three decades and while a lot of the other events may look to highlight the strengths of Tunisian culture, the basis of this festival is to bring in other civilizations and show how the country is open to outsiders.
